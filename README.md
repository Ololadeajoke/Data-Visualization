Vusualizing the Gender Gap in College Degrees

The Department of Education Statistics releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. 

The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.


Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set and explore the gender gap in STEM fields, which stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This gap is reported on often in the news and not everyone agrees that there is a gap.

In this project I'll explore how we can communicate the nuanced narrative of gender gap using effective data visualization.
